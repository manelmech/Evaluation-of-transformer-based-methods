The events of that day and those who were lost haven't been forgotten, nor should they ever be. It is our responsibility and duty to strive to bring something good out of all the horrible events of that day. (& it began the moment the first plane struck, there were many acts of bravery, heroism, self-sacrifice, and kindness). A beautiful monument will be built in honor and rememberance of those lost - however that is not the most important thing to do. The most important way to remember and honor those lost is to improve security, raise the standards of training for those in airports, in security, change and modify high rise rescue policies, new communications between fire and police departments,,,,,it is thru these that those loved ones that were lost will be truly honored.\n",
